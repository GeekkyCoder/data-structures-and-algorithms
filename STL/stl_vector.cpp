//  * vectors are used to store elements of similar data types. However, unlike arrays, the size of a vector can grow dynamically.

//  * That is, we can change the size of the vector during the execution of a program as per our requirements.

//  * Vectors are part of the C++ Standard Template Library. To use vectors, we need to include the vector header file in our program
