STL stands for Standard Template Library in C++. 
It is a collection of template classes and functions that 
are used to perform common programming tasks, 
such as sorting, searching, and manipulating data. 
The STL provides a set of generic and efficient 
algorithms, containers, and iterators that are widely used in C++ programming.


The STL is divided into three main components:
1) Containers 
2) Algorithms 
3) Iterators 

1) Containers: 
Containers are classes that store and organize data. 
The STL provides several types of containers, such as vectors, 
lists, and maps, that can be used to store and access data in different ways.


2) Algorithms:
Algorithms are functions that perform operations on the data 
stored in containers. The STL provides a wide range of algorithms for sorting, 
searching, and manipulating data, such as sort(), find(), and for_each().

3) Iterators: 
Iterators are objects that allow you to traverse the elements 
of a container. The STL provides several types of iterators, 
such as forward iterators, bidirectional iterators, 
and random-access iterators, that can be used to access the elements 
of a container in different ways.


More about STL in C++:
The STL is designed to be highly efficient, reusable, and easy to use, 
making it an essential tool for C++ programmers. 
It is widely used in the C++ programming community and is considered 
a fundamental part of the C++ language.
