          Question Question: ðŸ˜…
          since the characters are stored as contigious memory locations how does cout know and our character array has a size of 100 and only 4 bytes are reserved so rest of 96 blocks are empty and contain garbage values! how does cout stop printing when the content inside character array is printed ?

          answer: there is "\0" (null charcater) also known as terminator when the content is being printed and it reaches the last character which is z in this case after this charcater there will be "\0" null character in the character array! ðŸ˜„

          */

     // printing the character at 2nd index which is r in this case!
     cout << name[2]; // r


     // what if a add "\0" after first character ?

     // name[1]="\0";

     // this statement will print f only then which is at 0 index ,  after this index there is null character so it determine i need to stop here
     
      //f
     // cout<<name<<endl;
